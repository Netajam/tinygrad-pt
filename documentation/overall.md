Tinygrad is a deeplearning/neural network framework.
It allows you to code the operations that you require to build neural networks.
It also allows you to better control the flow of operations that will be sent to your GPU.
# Frontend
As a programmer only interested in building neural networks without the need to optimize the flow of execution you will only require to interact at the front-end level and use the operations availables.
Example of how the framework can be used can be fo# Frontendund in the different examples
